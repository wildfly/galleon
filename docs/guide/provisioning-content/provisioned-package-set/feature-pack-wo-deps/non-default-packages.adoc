##### Feature-pack non-default packages

Feature-pack may contain packages that are not marked as default in the *feature-pack.xml*. Non-default packages can be installed either:

*   implicitly, in case a default package expressed a dependency on a non-default package;

*   explicitly, in case a user explicitly selected a non-default package to be installed.
