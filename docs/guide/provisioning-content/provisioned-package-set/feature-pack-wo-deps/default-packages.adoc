##### Feature-pack default packages

Feature pack may define a set of default packages. This set of default packages is installed implicitly when the feature-pack is installed unless the user provides explicit instructions which packages to install.

Default packages are explicitly listed in the *feature-pack.xml* file which is a part of the feature-pack archive. For example:

[source,xml]
----
 <feature-pack xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-pack:1.0"
                groupId="org.jboss.fp.group1" artifactId="fp1" version="1.0.0" >
    <default-packages>
        <package name="package1" />
        <package name="package2" />
    </default-packages>
 </feature-pack>
----

In case this feature-pack is installed without further customizations, *package1* and *package2* will be installed by default, although the feature-pack above may still contain other packages (not listed as default) that may not get installed.
