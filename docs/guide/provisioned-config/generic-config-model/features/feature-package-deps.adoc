##### Feature package dependencies

[[feature-package-deps]]Feature specs representing configurable components of the installation may include dependencies on the feature-pack packages that contain the binaries of those installation components. So that, when a feature is included into a configuration, the packages it declared dependencies on will implicitly be added to the list of the installed packages.

Package dependencies are configured under the *packages* element of the feature spec which is equivalent to the <<package-deps,*dependencies* element of the package spec metadata>>. Here is an example
[source,xml]
----
 <feature-spec name="feature1" xmlns="urn:wildfly:pm-feature-spec:1.0">
   <params>
     <param name="id" feature-id="true"/>
   </params>
   <packages>
     <package name="p1"/>
     <package name="p2" optional="true"/>
     <feature-pack dependency="another-feature-pack">
       <package name="p2"/>
       <package name="p3" optional="true"/>
     </feature-pack>
   </packages>
 </feature-spec>
----

In this case, a feature of the *feature1* spec will have:

* a required dependency on the package *p1*;

* an optional dependency on the package *p2*;

* a required dependency on the package *p2* from the feature-pack dependency refered to as *another-feature-pack*;

* an optional dependency on the package *p3* from the feature-pack dependency refered to as *another-feature-pack*.
