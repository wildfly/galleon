#### Features

Minimal configurable unit of the generic configuration model is called a *feature*. A *feature* is described by a *feature specification* (or *feature spec* further in the text). A *feature spec* is like a type and a *feature* is an instance of that type.

Feature specs are identified by their names that must be unique in the scope of the feature-pack.

A feature spec describes

* the configurable parameters (including their names, default values (if any) and whether they are nillable);

* _(optionally)_ <<feature-refs,references to other feature specs>>;

* _(optionally)_ <<feature-deps,dependencies on other features>>;

* _(optionally)_ <<caps,required capabilities>>;

* _(optionally)_ <<caps,provided capabilities>>;

* _(optionally)_ <<feature-package-deps,dependencies on packages>>;

* _(optionally)_ <<feature-annotations,annnotations>>.

Feature specs are stored in the *spec.xml* files in the directories named after the feature spec names under the feature-pack's *features* directory. For example

[options="nowrap"]
 features/
 |-feature1/
 | `-spec.xml
 `-feature2/
   `-spec.xml
