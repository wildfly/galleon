#### Including customized feature groups

When a feature group is included (into another feature group or a `config` element of a feature-pack configuration) the set of its features can be customized. There are two main kinds of customizations that are allowed when including a feature group:

. <<feature-param-overwrites,the configuration of the features included into the group can be overwritten>>;

. certain features can be excluded from the group by

** <<fg-exclude-features-by-ids,specifying the feature IDs>>;

** <<fg-exclude-features-by-specs,specifying the specs features of which have to be excluded>>;

** <<fg-include-features-by-ids,explicitly choosing which features should be included by specifying their feature IDs>>;

** <<fg-include-features-by-specs,explicitly choosing features of which feature specs should be included>>.


IMPORTANT: When a feature group is included into another feature group or a `config` element, the list of its direct entries (features and feature groups) defined by the feature group spec cannot be extended by applying customizations. <<fg-indirect-ext,There is a way though to extend the feature set of the included feature group indirectly>>.

All the feature group customizations are expressed in the body of `feature-group` XML element.
