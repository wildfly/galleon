#### Excluding layers from configuration models

Layers that have been included into the configuration can later be excluded from it. The example above demonstrated how to include a layer into the configuration, here is an example of how a layer can be excluded:

[source,xml]
----
<installation xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:provisioning:2.0">
    <feature-pack location="prod1@maven(org.jboss.universe:community-universe):1#1.0.0.Final"/>
    <config xmlns="urn:jboss:galleon:config:1.0" model="model1" name="name1">
        <layers>
            <exclude name="layer2"/>
            <include name="layer3"/>
        </layers>
        <!-- the rest of the configuration -->
    </config>
</installation>
----

Assuming feature-pack `prod1` included `layer1` and `layer2` into its `model1:name1` configuration (as in the previous example), the resulting `model1:name1` configuration will include only `layer1` and `layer3` (and their dependencies if any).
